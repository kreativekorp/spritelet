# Spritelet v2

A Spritelet is a small box with a 128 x 128 pixel LCD screen for playing animations.

The Spritelet v2 software includes four applications:

  *  Clouds: Clouds from a kingdom on shrooms drift past the screen.
  *  Carousel: The main application. Displays animations and static images from an SD card.
  *  dX: An overengineered electronic dice roller.
  *  Toasters: Kitchen appliances with wings fly past the screen.

To make a Spritelet you will need the following hardware:

  *  One of the supported microcontroller boards.
  *  [Adafruit 1.44" Color TFT LCD Display w/ MicroSD](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2088)
  *  [Adafruit LiPoly Backpack Addon for Pro Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2124)
  *  [Lithium Ion Polymer Battery 3.7V 150mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1317)
  *  [Fast Vibration Sensor Switch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1766)
  *  [SPDT Slide Switch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/805)
  *  [Thru-Hole 5-Way Navigation Switch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/504)
  *  [SD/MicroSD Memory Card](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294)
  *  An interconnect board to connect all the above together.
  *  [3D-Printed Spritelet v2 Enclosure](https://www.shapeways.com/model/upload-and-buy/7529582)
  *  [4x Machine Screw #4-40](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/pomona-electronics/4862/501-1531-ND/745091)

Any of these supported microcontroller boards can be used:

  *  [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano)
  *  [Teensy 3.1/3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html)
  *  [Teensy LC](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyLC.html)
  *  [Adafruit Pro Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2000)
  *  [Adafruit ItsyBitsy 32u4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3677)
  *  [Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3727)

You can of course use any board supported by the Arduino IDE, but without an appropriate interconnect board you won't be able to make it into a finished product.
